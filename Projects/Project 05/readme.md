# CS 243 Assignment #5 - Chapter 5
1. Complete the project listed at the end of chapter 5 in the book.    

# Getting Started
Begin by creating a private repository in the course's [GitHub organization](https://github.com/HSU-F20-CS243).
Your repository name **__must__** be in the following format: ```p05-{HSU LOGIN}```.  Thus, my project repository
name would be ```p05-asc564```.  

Once created, your repository should have:
* a "chips" directory that contains your HDL solutions
* a "results" directory that contains screenshots from the testing results obtained through the hardware simulator

Below is an example static screenshot with test results:

**__NOTICE:__** Failing to set up your repository correctly will result in reduced assignment credit.  

# Design Diary Prompt
Design diaries should be a paragraph or two.  You will be graded on content (i.e. it shows 
deep thought) rather than syntax (e.g. spelling) and structure.  Below are some prompts that can be used to get 
you thinking.  Feel free to use these or to make up your own.
* Describe a particular struggle that you overcame when working on this programming assignment.
* Conversely, describe an issue with your assignment that you were unable to resolve.
* Provide advice to a future student on how he or she might succeed on this assignment.
* Describe the most fun aspect of the assignment.
* Describe the most challenging aspect of the assignment.
* Describe the most difficult aspect of the assignment to understand.
* Provide any suggestions for improving the assignment in the future.

Your design diary will be submitted on canvas and **__should not__** be included in your repository.
